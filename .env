# Database Safety Configuration
# CRITICAL: This should ALWAYS be false in production
# When false (default): Setup script only creates missing data, NEVER deletes existing user data
# When true: Allows database reset ONLY if database is completely empty (development only)

# EMAIL_FROM: The email address to send emails from
# 
# IMPORTANT: Domain verification for reliable email delivery
# The custom domain (hrhubly.com) requires verification in Resend dashboard
# 
# Current setting uses your private email address:
EMAIL_FROM="HR Hubly <info@hrhubly.com>"
# 
# Email Delivery Status:
# - If hrhubly.com is verified in Resend: Emails send from info@hrhubly.com ✅
# - If not yet verified: Emails automatically fall back to sandbox domain (onboarding@resend.dev) ⚠️
#   (Fallback ensures emails still work during development/testing)
# 
# To verify your domain in Resend for production use:
# 1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
# 2. Add hrhubly.com (if not already added)
# 3. Add the DNS records provided by Resend to your domain provider
#    Note: These are DIFFERENT from the privateemail.com MX/SPF records
#    Resend requires specific TXT records for domain verification
# 4. Wait for verification (usually 15-30 minutes)
# 5. Once verified, all emails will send from info@hrhubly.com
#
# The DNS records shown in your privateemail.com configuration are for receiving emails.
# Resend requires separate DNS records for sending emails (SPF, DKIM, etc.)

## ⚙️ Optional: For Full Features

To make emails, redirects, and other features work on your public URL:

1. Get your public URL
2. Edit `.env` file:
   ```env
   BASE_URL=https://your-actual-url.trycloudflare.com
   ```
3. Restart dev server (Ctrl+C, then `pnpm dev`)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Keep 2 Terminals Open:
```
Terminal 1: pnpm dev              # Your dev server
Terminal 2: pnpm quick-preview    # Your public tunnel
```

### The URL Changes Each Time:
- This is normal with Cloudflare's free tunnels
- You get a new URL each session
- For permanent URLs, deploy to production

### Share Your URL:
```
Send via email, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.
Anyone can open it and see your app!
(But only you can edit the code)
```
